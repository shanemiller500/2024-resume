I opted for static files due to their straightforwardness and efficiency, no need to overcode something simple like this. Many frameworks share similar setup processes, which makes finding solutions quick and easy with ample documentation and online community support sites (ge ithub, stackoverflow, etc). This approach enabled me to launch my project with my domain in just a few hours, showcasing my ability to handle tasks effectively and deliver results promptly. I'm skilled at quickly mastering different frameworks and deploying solutions on domains within a short timeframe. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and demonstrate my capabilities.

In Pages > Scripts, you'll discover JavaScript code that isn't included in the scripts.js file for the playground.
